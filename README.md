“Story of the Time when Gods were everywhere”
Art Attraction Installation

# I. Analysis
## 1. Research
This is a digital projection where participants take on the role of “God”. It is said that in ancient times there were gods in the forests, grasslands, mountains and rivers. People created pictographs in order to communicate with those gods. By touching the pictographs symbols (kanji/logographic Chinese character) of the participant “creates” all sorts of things from horses to elephants and even mountains, rain and fire. Narrative wise it tells a story of creation where each permutation of this story is never the same. Every experience is unique making this a very good example of generative art.

**a. Scope**
•	A call for the viewer’s completes engagement of body and mind which is capacities to move and to explore something behind it. 
•	To expand art and that digital can create new relationship between people which is encouraging changes in the relationships among people in the same space, and to make the presence of other people a positive experience, through digital art. 
•	To change individual creative acts into positive creative experiences with other people, and to create a ‘co-creative’ space that can be enjoyed by everyone.
•	To experience the connection between “characters” and “things we see in our world” through these characters.
•	Learn the concept of characters, pattern recognition and ability to grasp causality from this project. 
•	Stimulate those children/users that had never learnt Kanji before or those who do not really know what the characters are.


**a. Timeline/Schedule**

**b. Audit**

1. Field (market) research

In the past few years, a great amount of interest has been shown to develop indoor theme park in the shopping mall for the common user. The indoor theme park industry is healthy and growth is forecast due to increasing attendance numbers and greater per diem expenditures in park. However, theme parks can grow revenues further by incorporating other forms of leisure entertainment such as namely, gaming and the internet into their offering. Indoor theme parks also can improve guest satisfaction by alleviating wait times through technology and providing a more pleasant experience while waiting. 

Some issues addressed in this matter include:

•	Fewer teens visiting theme parks compared with five years ago
•	Most of the attractions games applied is bored towards audience
•	Art-based attractions could attract a new audience


Applying this type of installation over there can help to improvise the visiting of the theme parks. 




**2. Competitors / alternatives / replacement**


**VRCADE (A New Generation)**

•	Strap on a headset and be transported to a new dimension of gaming as you battle zombies in a full-motion, wireless, virtual reality world.

**example for the kanji symbols**

A multi-media art attraction installation used kanji symbol/character and the most advanced digital technologies to ethically engage the audience. Kanji which are used in today’s society and characters which become as beautiful symbols that connects with nature. We want children to experience the connection between “characters” and “things we see in our world” through these characters. Touching characters fluttering down, seeing how they react, or watching those characters changing into things that can be found in nature will stimulate those children who had never learnt Kanji before or those who do not really know what the characters are. After playing with the exhibit for a while, there might be a child who can visualize what forms of characters would mean what. In addition, we want children to have the opportunity to think how things that seem to be unrelated interact with one another by seeing the interaction of things in nature after the characters change.



 **Information**
•	It is said that in ancient times there were gods in the forests, grasslands, mountains and rivers. People created pictographs in order to communicate with those gods. Through the characters the world that you have created and the world called up by people around you continuously interact.

  **Functions**
•	Design of the installation in way works when children touch the characters the world contained in those characters opens up and the story begins. The objects that are born from the characters influence each other and are influenced by children`s actions. Children using their bodies and changing the world together can create a story. The objects that emerge from the symbols influence one another and are influenced by the actions of other people.

**Mechanism**
•	The system that being carried out throughout this project which is projection will display an image of different character/symbol on the wall.
•	Kinect being used to detect human motion for the touch interaction using finger sense.

**Actions**
•	About the project are the interactivity and its reliance on audience participation. As spectators touch using finger point onto the wall to see the projected content, characters the world contained in those characters opens up and the story begins.

## b.	Framework

**1. Sketch Design**

Design Overall Structure of the Installation art

The setup for this project is above. With the help of the projection and kinect sensor (human motion. The projection will be place on the top back of the ceiling and will be projected to the wall while the kinect will be place top of the wall ceiling above the wall screen.  The most interesting thing about the project is the interactivity and its reliance on audience participation. As spectators touch using finger point onto the wall to see the projected content, characters the world contained in those characters opens up and the story begins

## 2. Keypath Scenario

Once reach, she wondering of what’s going on with the exhibition and she saw other users touching on the wall and playing with animation. 
Later on, she tried to play with it by touching those symbols being created on the wall. Then, she touches of the symbol and realizing that the symbol gives out animation behind on it. Firstly, she saw a bird lands on a tree. Then she continuously keeps on touching on the other symbols since she wants to know what’s going on with the other symbol and there are varieties animation being produced such as a sheep runs away from a dog, and a sheep dances. She started to smile and begun to start her imagination to create some stories in it by using the animation being displayed on the wall. 
Later on, she creates a story of her imaginations and started to compete with other users interacting with it. Throughout these technologies, she created a new relationship between people which is encouraging changes in the relationships among people in the same space, and to make the presence of other people a positive experience. 
Moreover, she started to explore more on giving out her own stories and she finds out that there’s something she gain behind this where It is said that in ancient times there were gods in the forests, grasslands, mountains and rivers. People created pictographs in order to communicate with those gods. Through the characters the world that you have created and the world called up by people around you continuously interact. This made her behavior and those of people around her were influences how the story is created. Lastly, she gain something interesting that can improvised her creative skills for creating an artwork throughout her imagination.
